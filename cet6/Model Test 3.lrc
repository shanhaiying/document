[00:09.33]Model Test There
[00:11.41]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:14.60]Section A
[00:15.91]Directions: In this section, 
[00:18.30]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:21.07]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:24.11]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:25.89]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:28.74]about what was said. 
[00:30.37]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:32.99]will be spoken only once. 
[00:35.52]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:38.40]During the pause, 
[00:39.80]you must read the four choices 
[00:42.05]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:46.12]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:49.51]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:53.27]with a single line through the centre.
[00:55.78]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[01:00.53]1. W: That picture certainly flatters Sue. 
[01:04.94]She looks great in the picture. 
[01:06.98]Don¡¯t you think so? 
[01:08.29]M: No, I don¡¯t. As a matter of fact, 
[01:10.40]I think it makes her look older than she really is. 
[01:13.75]Q: What does the man imply? 
[01:30.39]2. W: Do you happen to know 
[01:33.18]what the temperature is today? 
[01:35.29]I missed today¡¯s weather forecast over the radio. 
[01:38.50]M: It feels like 5 degrees below zero at least. 
[01:41.36]I don¡¯t mind the cold weather, 
[01:43.14]but I do hate it when the ground gets slippery. 
[01:45.80]Q: What can be inferred from the conversation? 
[02:03.28]3. M: How about this cleaning milk? 
[02:06.10]It cleans thoroughly 
[02:07.59]without striping your natural protective oil. 
[02:10.27]The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy. 
[02:14.16]W: Hmm...the smell is too strong 
[02:16.54]and I¡¯m very sensitive to fragrance. 
[02:18.67]Q: What do we learn from the conversation? 
[02:36.01]4. W: Classical music is definitely my favorite. 
[02:40.09]It helps me to calm down. 
[02:41.97]I love the sound of an orchestra 
[02:44.44]playing a great symphony. 
[02:46.31]Do you ever listen to classical music? 
[02:48.49]M: Sometimes, but I find jazz more relaxing. 
[02:51.88]The beat is much stronger. 
[02:53.45]Q: What do we learn from the conversation? 
[03:11.02]5. W: Jack, why didn¡¯t you invite Peter 
[03:14.75]to your birthday party? 
[03:16.36]After all, he is my brother. 
[03:18.55]M: Well, I¡¯m so sorry. 
[03:20.04]But to be frank, 
[03:21.48]he is such a wet blanket 
[03:23.05]with that sour look on his face. 
[03:24.87]I was afraid he would spoil the party. 
[03:27.08]Q: What does the man imply? 
[03:43.93]6. W: Paul, could you bring my calculator back? 
[03:48.01]I need it to do my math homework tonight. 
[03:50.36]M: Well, I don¡¯t know how to put this. 
[03:52.71]But I dropped it, 
[03:54.17]and now the ¡°on¡± button doesn¡¯t light. 
[03:56.78]Q: What does the man mean? 
[04:13.48]7. M: This is a very expensive watch. 
[04:16.69]But I¡¯ve had trouble with it 
[04:18.36]ever since I bought it. 
[04:19.50]I insist on seeing the manager. 
[04:21.57]W: Actually there is no need for doing that, Sir. 
[04:24.88]I¡¯ll give you another watch just like this one. 
[04:27.79]Q: What is the man doing? 
[04:44.15]8. W: I had a feeling 
[04:46.31]that Lucy was not so close to Jim 
[04:48.40]as she used to be. 
[04:49.70]What happened to them? 
[04:51.11]M: Yeah, when she heard about his background, 
[04:53.68]she decided that she¡¯d better keep him 
[04:55.97]at arm¡¯s length. 
[04:57.28]Q: What do we know from the conversation? 
[05:14.39]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:17.76]Conversation One 
[05:21.18]M: Michelle Hackman, a high school senior, 
[05:23.57]won second place in a national science competition. 
[05:27.55]She conducted a study to see what happens 
[05:30.11]when a teenager is deprived of his or her phone. 
[05:33.42]She joins us on the phone. 
[05:35.17]Thanks very much for being with us. 
[05:36.99]W: Thank you so much. 
[05:38.57]M: And what did you do¡ª
[05:39.76]just took cell phones out of teenagers¡¯ hands 
[05:42.09]and started studying them? 
[05:43.56]W: Yeah, I based my research on a market research study 
[05:47.61]that made the claim that the reason 
[05:49.49]we can¡¯t separate from our phones is 
[05:51.18]that we become anxious. 
[05:52.95]And so I wanted to see 
[05:54.41]whether I would see that sort of behavior 
[05:56.47]if I were to do that experimentally, 
[05:58.38]just took the cell phones away from kids. 
[06:01.34]M: And? 
[06:02.06]W: And I actually found when I took them away, 
[06:05.19]the kids became under-stimulated, 
[06:07.42]and almost didn¡¯t know how to entertain themselves. 
[06:10.05]M: Oh. How did you observe? 
[06:12.23]W: I used a biological feedback device. 
[06:14.76]I observed levels of stimulation. 
[06:16.86]And I literally saw that subjects 
[06:19.33]who had phones taken away from them 
[06:21.13]experienced decreases in their stimulation. 
[06:24.25]M: Now, I have been told you¡¯re blind. 
[06:26.20]W: Yes.
[06:27.78]M: How did you conduct the study? 
[06:29.71]W: I couldn¡¯t actually conduct the study myself 
[06:33.17]because of the readings on the biological feedback meter, 
[06:36.21]I couldn¡¯t take them myself. 
[06:37.76]So I actually gathered a team of students 
[06:40.76]to administer the study for me. 
[06:42.78]M: So what are you going to do? 
[06:44.18]What are your plans? 
[06:46.12]W: I¡¯m going to go to Yale in the fall 
[06:47.93]to study psychology, 
[06:49.34]and I will bring the cell phone research with me. 
[06:52.73]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[06:57.09]you have just heard.
[06:59.54]9. What happened to those 
[07:01.56]whose cell phones were taken away? 
[07:18.51]10. How did the woman conduct the study? 
[07:37.25]11. What will the woman do next? 
[07:55.44]Conversation Two 
[07:57.52]W: Devon, I heard that you took the train across Russia. 
[08:00.66]M: Yes, I started in Moscow, 
[08:02.69]travelled through Russia and ended in Mongolia. 
[08:05.56]It took three weeks. 
[08:07.02]W: Wow! That¡¯s a long way! 
[08:09.30]What was the landscape like? 
[08:11.27]M: A lot of it was flat and for miles around 
[08:13.90]you could see absolutely nothing, 
[08:15.89]and as you got into Siberia 
[08:17.68]there were scattered trees, 
[08:19.32]and when you got into Mongolia 
[08:20.93]you could see some camels every once in a while, 
[08:23.69]but besides that there was a whole lot of nothing. 
[08:26.64]W: Wow! Just wild camels? 
[08:28.77]M: Wild camels around the drinking hole. 
[08:31.03]Yes, I saw that more than once. 
[08:33.80]W: So how did you eat on train? 
[08:36.75]M: We stopped several times along the way 
[08:38.88]and upon every platform 
[08:40.71]you could buy food that local people were selling. 
[08:43.36]A lot of it consisted of dried fish 
[08:46.10]and other types of Russian delicacies 
[08:48.32]and noodles that you could heat up with hot water. 
[08:50.85]Every train had hot water on it 
[08:53.09]so you were always able to make noodles 
[08:55.16]if you were desperate. 
[08:56.71]W: So were they luxurious trains 
[08:58.86]or pretty basic ones? 
[09:00.39]M: They were pretty much the most basic 
[09:02.30]you could get. 
[09:03.62]There were no animals on board 
[09:05.10]but sometimes they were coal heated 
[09:07.53]so they were very basic. 
[09:09.57]W: Wow! Would you do it again? 
[09:11.64]M: Great question! Would I do it again? 
[09:14.05]Yes, I would do it again 
[09:15.83]but I would wait several years to do it. 
[09:17.97]One is because it does cost a lot of money 
[09:20.90]and the other is because 
[09:22.28]there are many other things to do first. 
[09:25.61]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[09:29.30]you have just heard.
[09:32.21]12. What do we know about the trip? 
[09:50.36]13. What did the man say about the landscape? 
[10:09.88]14. How did the man eat on train? 
[10:28.27]15. What does the man plan to do? 
[10:46.99]Section B 
[10:48.33]Directions: In this section, 
[10:51.05]you will hear 3 short passages
[10:53.59]At the end of each passage, 
[10:55.67]you will hear some questions. 
[10:57.43]Both the passage and the questions 
[10:59.95]will be spoken only once. 
[11:02.15]After you hear a question, 
[11:04.30]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[11:07.63]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:11.00]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:15.80]with a single line through the centre.
[11:18.18]Passage One 
[11:19.58]Hundreds of students from around the world 
[11:22.27]gathered in New York City last month 
[11:24.54]for the Microsoft Imagine Cup finals. 
[11:27.11]They came to present their ideas 
[11:28.80]for using technology to solve world problems. 
[11:31.96]Microsoft Education Director Suzi Levine 
[11:35.01]says the nine-year-old program began mainly 
[11:37.85]as a competition to create technology. 
[11:40.35]Suzi Levine says, ¡°When we realized 
[11:43.07]that students really want to have a purpose 
[11:45.52]for what they¡¯re creating, 
[11:46.95]we introduced the idea of inspiring them 
[11:49.35]with the UN Millennium Development Goals 
[11:51.72]and suggesting that they use those for their thinking.¡± 
[11:54.71]New sources for ideas this year 
[11:57.54]included intergovernmental 
[11:59.47]and nongovernmental organizations. 
[12:02.15]Suzi Levine says, ¡°This past year 
[12:05.04]we also rolled out something called 
[12:07.06]the Imagine Cup Solve This Library, 
[12:09.49]where those organizations can submit 
[12:12.48]some of the technical challenges 
[12:14.32]that they would like students 
[12:15.78]to consider for their solutions.¡± 
[12:17.62]Microsoft says 
[12:19.02]over 350,000 high school and college students 
[12:23.07]registered for the recent competition. 
[12:25.67]Judges chose more than 400 of them to attend the finals. 
[12:29.77]Ms Levine says several teams were inspired
[12:33.40]by current events, 
[12:34.60]including floods last year in Thailand. 
[12:37.12]One from Thailand was called NewKrean, 
[12:40.63]who created a Windows Phone 7 application 
[12:43.75]that allows one to broadcast his location 
[12:46.39]to his social network friends 
[12:48.29]so that he can be more easily rescued. 
[12:51.38]Students competed in nine categories. 
[12:54.01]For example, 
[12:54.94]in software design the top prize of 25,000 dollars 
[12:58.62]went to team Hermes from Ireland. 
[13:01.07]The students developed a device for cars 
[13:03.86]to collect information on road conditions, 
[13:06.35]driving behavior and traffic accidents. 
[13:08.85]Next year, 
[13:09.88]the awards ceremony will take place in Australia. 
[13:13.85]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage 
[13:17.06]you have just heard.
[13:19.76]16. What do we know about the Microsoft Imagine Cup? 
[13:39.17]17. What role do intergovernmental 
[13:42.85]and nongovernmental organizations play? 
[14:00.79]18. What does the passage say 
[14:03.45]about the creation of the team from Thailand? 
[14:20.73]19. What is the device developed by the team 
[14:24.71]from Ireland designed for? 
[14:41.84]Passage Two 
[14:44.12]Harvard University is unarguably 
[14:46.65]one of the most prestigious universities in the world. 
[14:50.36]Founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1636, 
[14:54.68]it is among the oldest in the United States. 
[14:57.85]In 2007, Harvard named historian and scholar 
[15:01.90]Drew Gilpin Faust its 28th president. 
[15:05.39]She is the first woman to hold that position. 
[15:09.58]Other American universities have had women presidents. 
[15:13.44]But when Harvard named Drew Gilpin Faust 
[15:15.79]as its first woman president, 
[15:17.71]the world took note. 
[15:20.27]¡°At a press conference 
[15:21.41]right after the announcement of my appointment, 
[15:23.60]I was asked something about what it felt like 
[15:26.25]to be the first woman president of Harvard,¡± 
[15:28.80]Faust recalls. 
[15:30.29]¡°My response, which I had not thought in advance, 
[15:33.27]was that I wasn¡¯t the woman president of Harvard, 
[15:35.89]I was the president of Harvard.¡± 
[15:38.58]But Faust soon realized that being the first woman 
[15:41.23]to hold that position did matter to a lot of people. 
[15:45.63]¡°The response to my appointment 
[15:47.06]from young girls and women all over the world, 
[15:49.57]from the parents of young girls, 
[15:51.39]was so moving,¡± she says. 
[15:53.63]¡°They found in my appointment 
[15:55.19]an indication of hope and aspiration 
[15:57.48]that they or their children could embrace. 
[16:00.50]And that made me recognize 
[16:02.06]that being the first woman president of Harvard 
[16:04.40]has a lot of significance, 
[16:06.03]and I ought not to forget.¡± 
[16:08.67]Since becoming president of Harvard, 
[16:10.92]Faust has made it a priority to ensure 
[16:13.25]that the cost of education 
[16:14.93]at the elite private university 
[16:17.19]does not prohibit talented applicants from attending. 
[16:21.10]The annual tuition, room and board 
[16:23.44]for a Harvard undergraduate is more than $ 50,000, 
[16:27.27]but the majority of students pay much less. 
[16:31.23]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage 
[16:34.91]you have just heard.
[16:37.54]20. What do we know about Drew Gilpin Faust? 
[16:56.58]21. What did Faust think of her nomination? 
[17:15.87]22. What did Faust do 
[17:19.00]after she became president of Harvard? 
[17:36.36]Passage Three 
[17:38.88]The banking profession doesn¡¯t have a very good reputation 
[17:41.87]for customer service at the moment. 
[17:44.51]High street branches are shutting down 
[17:46.99]and where banks are available, 
[17:48.86]their opening hours are inconvenient. 
[17:51.25]Staff at the desks are rude, 
[17:53.29]increasingly under-qualified 
[17:55.34]and often unable to answer questions. 
[17:58.21]And if customers try to contact the bank by telephone, 
[18:01.62]they are put through to a call centre 
[18:03.38]in another country 
[18:04.69]where they have to speak slowly 
[18:06.07]in order to be understood. 
[18:08.10]Astonishingly, however, 
[18:09.88]86% of the customers at First National bank 
[18:13.46]are either extremely satisfied 
[18:15.61]or very satisfied with the service they receive. 
[18:18.70]And what is even more surprising is 
[18:20.80]that this bank has no high street outlets at all. 
[18:25.19]First National bank is run entirely 
[18:27.36]through the telephone and the Internet. 
[18:29.49]And its success shows that customer service 
[18:32.04]is just about face-to-face contact with clients. 
[18:35.68]The primary concern of the bank 
[18:37.58]is recruiting the right people. 
[18:39.91]They have the attitude that some skills, 
[18:41.95]such as keyboard skills and so on, can be taught, 
[18:45.44]but staff can¡¯t be taught to be a nice person. 
[18:48.42]So they only recruit people 
[18:49.89]who already exhibit good communication skills. 
[18:53.29]And unlike other services 
[18:54.68]that operate primarily over the telephone, 
[18:57.22]the staff at First National Bank do not use scripts. 
[19:00.90]The managers recognize 
[19:02.16]that customers find them impersonal and unnatural. 
[19:05.77]What this bank asks for 
[19:07.51]is that staff be themselves 
[19:09.27]and establish a good relationship with their customers. 
[19:12.44]Part of this is recognizing people¡¯s needs. 
[19:15.54]Staff have to pick up on the caller¡¯s mood 
[19:18.14]and react accordingly. 
[19:21.15]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage 
[19:25.08]you have just heard.
[19:28.01]23. Why is the experience of contacting banks 
[19:32.26]by telephone usually unhappy? 
[19:49.31]24. What kind of people does First National bank 
[19:53.74]intend to recruit? 
[20:10.10]25. What do we know about the First National bank?
[20:29.22]Section C
[20:30.56]Directions: In this section, 
[20:32.98]you will hear a passage three times. 
[20:35.79]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[20:38.57]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[20:42.22]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[20:45.12]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[20:47.66]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[20:50.48]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[20:54.26]you should check what you have written.
[20:56.59]Now listen to the passage.
[20:59.41]Cheating scandals have rocked a number of school districts 
[21:02.51]across the country this year. 
[21:04.62]What happened in Atlanta is hard to imagine. 
[21:07.74]Dozens of administrators and teachers 
[21:10.35]changed answers on standardized tests. 
[21:13.20]When those tests showed big gains, 
[21:15.42]school leaders took the credit. 
[21:17.73]But they were caught, 
[21:18.85]in part, because Georgia investigators 
[21:21.37]have been looking for signs of changing answers for years.
[21:25.20]Kathleen Mathers, 
[21:26.51]who runs Georgia¡¯s Office of Student Achievement, 
[21:29.38]says her state is in its third year 
[21:31.32]of using erasure analysis 
[21:33.43]of all elementary and middle school tests. 
[21:36.45]She says the scanners can differentiate 
[21:38.75]¡°between an answer choice that is definitely made 
[21:41.81]and intended to be the answer choice, 
[21:44.13]and answer choices that were previously made 
[21:46.44]and then erased.¡± 
[21:47.93]Mathers says that analysis costs the state 
[21:51.11]about $ 27 000¡ªa small fraction of its testing budget. 
[21:56.28]The data established that in many schools 
[21:59.34]there were just too many switches from wrong to right.
[22:03.07]Prof. Gary Miron of Western Michigan University 
[22:06.60]says this problem is part of the troubled result 
[22:09.20]of No Child Left Behind. 
[22:11.44]The law said test scores would determine 
[22:13.67]the fate of entire schools. 
[22:15.99]Schools that fail can be shut down, 
[22:18.33]and bad test scores can also harm funding. 
[22:22.05]And now a growing number of states 
[22:24.25]are planning to evaluate teachers based in part 
[22:26.94]on test scores.
[22:28.75]Miron also says before No Child Left Behind, 
[22:32.27]schools tested less often and more carefully. 
[22:36.68]¡°No Child Left Behind required testing to be rolled out 
[22:40.10]at each of the grades between grades three and eight, ¡± 
[22:43.50]he says. 
[22:44.62]But with this it meant 
[22:46.34]that we had to distribute the resources for testing

[22:55.73]Cheating scandals have rocked a number of school districts 
[22:59.26]across the country this year. 
[23:01.56]What happened in Atlanta is hard to imagine. 
[23:05.11]Dozens of administrators and teachers 
[23:07.53]changed answers on standardized tests. 
[23:11.13]When those tests showed big gains, 
[23:13.52]school leaders took the credit. 
[23:16.06]But they were caught, 
[23:17.23]in part, because Georgia investigators 
[23:19.84]have been looking for signs of changing answers for years.
[23:24.30]Kathleen Mathers, 
[23:25.60]who runs Georgia¡¯s Office of Student Achievement, 
[23:28.57]says her state is in its third year 
[23:30.76]of using erasure analysis 
[23:32.70]of all elementary and middle school tests. 
[23:36.51]She says the scanners can differentiate 
[23:39.26]¡°between an answer choice that is definitely made 
[23:42.04]and intended to be the answer choice, 
[23:44.59]and answer choices that were previously made 
[23:47.01]and then erased.¡± 
[23:48.64]Mathers says that analysis costs the state 
[23:51.32]about $ 27 000¡ªa small fraction of its testing budget. 
[23:56.78]The data established that in many schools 
[23:59.25]there were just too many switches from wrong to right.
[24:03.75]Prof. Gary Miron of Western Michigan University 
[24:07.22]says this problem is part of the troubled result 
[24:10.14]of No Child Left Behind. 
[24:12.75]The law said test scores would determine 
[24:15.16]the fate of entire schools. 
[24:17.54]Schools that fail can be shut down, 
[24:19.99]and bad test scores can also harm funding. 
[24:23.53]And now a growing number of states 
[24:25.42]are planning to evaluate teachers based in part 
[24:28.28]on test scores.
[24:30.85]Miron also says before No Child Left Behind, 
[24:34.44]schools tested less often and more carefully. 
[24:38.12]¡°No Child Left Behind required testing to be rolled out 
[24:41.45]at each of the grades between grades three and eight, ¡± 
[24:44.57]he says. 
[24:45.62]But with this it meant 
[24:47.02]that we had to distribute the resources for testing 
[24:49.55]across more grades.
