[00:07.51]Model Test Two
[00:09.53]Part II  Listening Comprehension      
[00:12.36]Section A
[00:13.41]Directions: In this section, 
[00:15.90]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:18.81]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:21.79]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:23.55]one or more questions will be asked 
[00:26.58]about what was said. 
[00:27.99]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:30.64]will be spoken only once. 
[00:33.21]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:36.27]During the pause, you must read the four choices 
[00:39.78]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:43.85]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:47.03]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:50.71]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.71]Now let¡¯s begin with the 8 short conversations.
[00:58.65]1. W: I absolutely love what you¡¯re wearing today. 
[01:02.95]Seriously, it looks really nice on you. 
[01:05.53]Where did you buy it?
[01:07.25]M: Thank you. 
[01:08.29]I bought it from the Macy¡¯s at the Santa Anita mall.
[01:11.74]Q: What are the two speakers talking about?
[01:29.90]2. M: Excuse me, Madam. 
[01:33.14]Didn¡¯t you see the red light? 
[01:35.26]May I see your driver¡¯s license, please? 
[01:37.71]W: Oh, I thought I could make a right 
[01:40.09]when it turns on red here.
[01:42.51]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[02:01.70]3. W: Hi, Burt. 
[02:04.07]I heard you¡¯re looking for a new job. 
[02:06.38]How is it going?
[02:07.63]M: I just had an interview yesterday. 
[02:10.24]I think I did well. 
[02:12.38]The director seemed to like me. 
[02:14.59]They said they would make a decision by this Friday. 
[02:17.38]I believe I have a very good chance.
[02:20.17]Q: What does the man think of his interview?
[02:38.97]4. W: How is your new roommate?
[02:41.65]M: Well, all I could say is 
[02:43.97]that he¡¯s a real couch potato. 
[02:46.09]Last weekend he invited me over 
[02:48.08]to his parent¡¯s house to watch TV. 
[02:50.50]I bet watching TV is his only hobby, 
[02:53.49]but he surely doesn¡¯t know much.
[02:56.28]Q: What can we learn about the man¡¯s new roommate?
[03:14.80]5. M: Hi, Carol. 
[03:17.72]I was just wondering 
[03:19.03]if you would come by this afternoon 
[03:20.77]and give me a hand with the decoration 
[03:22.68]for next week¡¯s party.
[03:24.36]W: I¡¯m sorry, Bill. I really can¡¯t today. 
[03:27.18]I have to go to the airport to meet my parents 
[03:30.00]coming back from France.
[03:31.74]Q: What will the man possibly do this afternoon?
[03:50.95]6. W: You want to teach English 
[03:54.05]to non-native speakers overseas? 
[03:56.32]That sounds really exciting. 
[03:58.56]And do you need some type of specific degree 
[04:01.99]or experience to do that?
[04:04.10]M: Well, most employers overseas are looking for someone 
[04:07.91]who has at least a Bachelor¡¯s degree 
[04:10.38]and one or two years of teaching experience.
[04:13.80]Q: What are the requirements of 
[04:15.89]being an English teacher overseas?
[04:33.41]7. W: Hey, Markus. 
[04:35.73]I have a question to ask you. 
[04:37.39]Well, I¡¯m thinking about going to Germany this summer, 
[04:40.61]and I need some advice. 
[04:42.51]You¡¯re the best person I know to answer my questions 
[04:45.51]since you¡¯re German.
[04:46.90]M: Thank you for saying so. 
[04:48.71]What do you want to know?
[04:52.27]Q: What can we infer from the conversation?
[05:12.55]8. W: It¡¯s Sara¡¯s birthday today. 
[05:16.08]We¡¯re planning on having dinner around 6:30 
[05:19.42]and then seeing a movie at 7:30. 
[05:22.41]And we¡¯re throwing her a small birthday party 
[05:25.04]after the movie. 
[05:26.49]Come and join us.
[05:27.75]M: Sure. Best friends always stick together.
[05:32.18]Q: What can we learn from the conversation?
[05:50.12]Now you will hear the 2 long conversations.
[05:53.90]Conversation One
[05:56.07]W: English Language Center. How may I help you? 
[05:59.31]M: Yes. I¡¯m calling to find out more information 
[06:02.79]about your program. 
[06:04.69]W: Well, first of all, the purpose of our program 
[06:07.92]is to provide language learning opportunities 
[06:10.88]to this area¡¯s community, whether a student¡¯s goal 
[06:14.80]is to master basic functional language skills 
[06:17.58]for his or her job, 
[06:19.10]or to enter a US college or university. 
[06:22.68]M: Okay. I¡¯m calling just for a friend 
[06:25.89]who is interested in attending a US university. 
[06:29.40]W: And that¡¯s the kind of instruction that we provide, 
[06:33.45]from basic communication courses to content-based classes 
[06:37.75]such as computer literacy, intercultural communication, 
[06:41.99]and business English. 
[06:44.09]M: Great. 
[06:45.13]What are your application deadlines 
[06:47.43]for the next semester? 
[06:49.08]W: Well, we ask applicants to apply 
[06:51.85]no later than two months before the semester begins. 
[06:55.73]M: And how does one apply? 
[06:58.06]W: Well, we can send you an application 
[07:00.93]and you can email it back to us, 
[07:03.45]or you can fill out our application on our website. 
[07:07.31]M: And are there other materials 
[07:09.65]I would need to send in addition to the application form? 
[07:13.10]W: Yes. You would need to send in 
[07:15.58]a $35 non-refundable application fee, 
[07:19.82]a sponsorship form indicating 
[07:21.84]who will be responsible financially for the student 
[07:25.24]when studying in our program, 
[07:27.46]and a bank statement showing 
[07:29.29]that you or your sponsor has sufficient funds 
[07:32.39]to cover tuition expenses 
[07:34.05]and living costs for the entire year of study. 
[07:37.36]M: And how can I send these materials to you? 
[07:41.03]W: You can either send the application packet 
[07:43.57]by regular mail or you can fax it. 
[07:46.46]M: And what is the tuition for a full-time student?
[07:50.77]W: It¡¯s two thousand thirty dollars. 
[07:53.74]We accept cash and credit cards. 
[07:56.26]M: I think that¡¯s all about it. 
[07:58.39]W: Okay, great.
[08:01.38]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[08:04.74]you have just heard. 
[08:07.09]9. Which is mentioned as a course 
[08:10.32]of the English Language Center?
[08:27.83]10. If the next semester starts on September 1st, 
[08:32.06]when is the deadline of application?
[08:49.99]11. What are needed in the application packet?
[09:09.78]Conversation Two
[09:12.32]W: Have you ever attended a group interview? 
[09:15.04]I mean an interview with a group of interviewers 
[09:17.71]from different areas of the company.
[09:20.26]M: Of course yes. 
[09:21.69]Every interviewer has his own particular interest. 
[09:25.87]An HR manager might want to know 
[09:28.84]if you are a good fit for the company, 
[09:31.50]the team leader of the office you are interviewing for 
[09:34.04]might want to see your personality 
[09:36.01]and if it fits with other colleagues, 
[09:39.05]and a supervisor might be there to assess your skills. 
[09:43.03]W: It seems you do know a lot about it. 
[09:45.44]Would you mind giving me some advice on how to handle it?
[09:49.13]M: Well, being interviewed by a group of interviewers 
[09:52.53]is really stressful and the company wants to know 
[09:55.93]if you can handle it.
[09:57.66]So, I¡¯d suggest practising a group interview 
[10:01.17]with friends beforehand. 
[10:03.41]This could help you deal with the real stress. 
[10:06.19]I believe you can turn the interview 
[10:08.24]into a positive experience 
[10:10.33]by being confident and having the right mindset.
[10:14.26]W: Should I collect some information about the group?
[10:17.82]M: This might possibly work. 
[10:20.11]But what really matters is how you fit the job. 
[10:23.80]Make sure you fully understand the job description 
[10:27.33]and what will be required of you.
[10:30.10]W: How about the company profile?
[10:32.50]M: You should also know how the company works, 
[10:35.29]its culture, and how it is structured.
[10:38.32]W: How should I make eye contact with the panel?
[10:41.94]M: Look directly at the person 
[10:44.17]who asked you the question, 
[10:45.89]but take the time to make eye contact 
[10:48.33]with the other interviewers. 
[10:50.17]However, your attention should be mainly 
[10:52.65]focused on the person who posed you the question.
[10:57.35]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[11:01.00]you have just heard. 
[11:03.25]12. What does the team leader of the office 
[11:07.29]want to know in an interview?
[11:24.41]13. What¡¯s the man¡¯s suggestion 
[11:27.42]about handling stress?
[11:44.53]14. How should an interviewee make eye contact 
[11:49.16]in a group interview?
[12:05.42]15. What can we learn from the conversation?
[12:24.88]Section B
[12:25.98]Directions: In this section, 
[12:28.20]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[12:31.00]At the end of each passage, 
[12:32.91]you will hear some questions. 
[12:34.90]Both the passage and the questions 
[12:37.38]will be spoken only once. 
[12:39.68]After you hear a question, 
[12:41.50]you must choose the best answer 
[12:43.64]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[12:47.48]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[12:51.88]with a single line through the centre.
[12:54.82]Passage One
[12:57.19]An elementary school bus driver pulled into 
[13:00.76]a gas station in Ohio 
[13:02.66]because he had to use the bathroom. 
[13:05.16]Instead of turning off the engine 
[13:07.86]and taking the key with him, 
[13:09.61]the driver left the bus running. 
[13:12.49]There were 20 kids on the bus. 
[13:15.06]The driver told a police officer 
[13:17.53]that it was cold outside, 
[13:19.60]and he didn¡¯t want the kids to get chilly 
[13:21.99]while he was using the bathroom. 
[13:24.24]But he forgot to set the emergency brake 
[13:27.94]because he was in a hurry. 
[13:30.16]The bus slowly started rolling away from the gas station. 
[13:35.22]As the bus picked up speed, 
[13:37.43]the kids began yelling and screaming. 
[13:40.57]Ten-year-old Jake ran forward to the driver¡¯s seat 
[13:44.29]and grabbed the steering wheel. 
[13:46.68]He pressed hard on the brake pedal 
[13:49.03]and managed to stop the bus 
[13:51.07]as it approached a guard rail overlooking a river. 
[13:54.84]Jake turned off the engine. 
[13:57.08]After the cops arrived at the scene, 
[13:59.92]they congratulated Jake on his heroic effort. 
[14:04.22]Jake wasn¡¯t impressed with what he had done. 
[14:07.64]He thought stopping the bus was easy 
[14:10.58]compared to playing his favorite action video game. 
[14:14.47]The bus driver, walking along the highway 
[14:17.40]when arrested by the police, 
[14:19.24]was initially charged with¡°leaving a child unattended 
[14:23.73]while motor vehicle is running.¡± 
[14:26.67]While that is only a minor driving violation, 
[14:29.71]the county district attorney said 
[14:32.53]he hoped to upgrade the charge 
[14:34.61]because of the number of children involved. 
[14:38.20]The district attorney believe that 
[14:40.04]whatever the driver is charged with, 
[14:42.29]the driver will  never drive a bus in this county again.
[14:47.12]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[14:50.29]you have just heard.
[14:52.51]16. Why did the driver leave the bus?
[15:12.11]17. Who managed to stop the bus 
[15:15.26]from running into the river?
[15:32.28]18. What will the driver¡¯s future probably be 
[15:36.93]according to the district attorney?
[15:54.82]Passage Two
[15:56.65]Burning fallen leaves used to be standard practice 
[15:59.77]across North America, 
[16:01.41]but most districts now ban or discourage this practice 
[16:05.44]due to the air pollution it causes.
[16:07.94]What¡¯s more, because of the moisture 
[16:10.65]that is usually trapped within leaves, 
[16:13.07]they tend to burn slowly 
[16:15.17]and thus generate large amounts of particles in the air, 
[16:18.75]such as bits of dust, smoke and other solid materials. 
[16:22.96]These particles can reach deep into lung tissue 
[16:26.43]and cause coughing, chest pain, 
[16:28.60]shortness of breath and other breathing problems.
[16:32.30]Individual leaf fires from time to time 
[16:35.56]usually don¡¯t cause any major pollution, 
[16:38.59]but multiple fires in one geographic area 
[16:41.73]can cause concentrations of air pollutants 
[16:44.83]that exceed federal air quality standards. 
[16:47.86]According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
[16:51.09](EPA), several leaf and yard waste fires 
[16:54.43]burning simultaneously in a particular place 
[16:57.41]can cause air pollution which equals 
[16:59.65]that from factories, motor vehicles and lawn equipment.
[17:04.49]On the contrary, leaves can be made fertilizer, 
[17:07.74]which is the most eco-friendly alternative to burning. 
[17:11.60]Dry leaves alone will take a long time to break down, 
[17:14.46]but mixing in green plant materials, such as grass, 
[17:18.36]will speed up the process. 
[17:20.53]Sources of nitrogen,
[17:22.41]such as livestock wastes or commercial fertilizer, 
[17:25.66]will also help.
[17:27.37]Another option is to chop leaves for use 
[17:30.04]as cover for your lawn or to help protect garden 
[17:33.37]and landscape plants. 
[17:35.06]But before you add no more than 
[17:37.52]a two-to-three-inch layer of leaves 
[17:39.56]around actively growing plants, 
[17:41.54]chop the leaves first 
[17:43.38]so they don¡¯t prevent air from reaching roots.
[17:47.21]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage 
[17:50.61]you have just heard.
[17:52.32]19. Why do most cities discourage burning fallen leaves?
[18:13.23]20. Why can fallen leaves cause air pollutants?
[18:33.54]21. What is the most eco-friendly way 
[18:37.48]to deal with fallen leaves?
[18:55.38]Passage Three
[18:57.23]Many of the Dutch expressions 
[18:59.05]heard in American English 
[19:01.01]were first used in England 
[19:02.98]in the seventeenth century. 
[19:05.44]That was a time of fierce naval competition 
[19:08.47]between England and the Netherlands. 
[19:10.84]At that time, the British used Dutch 
[19:13.92]as a word for something bad, false or mistaken.  
[19:18.13]Some of those old expressions are still used today, 
[19:22.62]with a little different meaning.
[19:25.19]Dutch treat is one example. 
[19:27.81]Long ago, a Dutch treat was a dinner 
[19:30.13]at which the invited guests were expected 
[19:32.92]to pay for their own share of the food and drink. 
[19:36.30]Now, Dutch treat means that 
[19:38.97]when friends go out to have fun, 
[19:40.89]each person pays his own share. 
[19:43.90]Another common expression heard a few years ago 
[19:47.26]was in Dutch. 
[19:48.90]If someone told you that you were in Dutch, 
[19:51.78]they were telling you that you were in trouble. 
[19:54.83]Some of the Dutch expressions heard in American English 
[19:58.65]have nothing to do with the Dutch people at all.
[20:02.20]In the seventeen hundreds, 
[20:04.55]Germans who moved to the United States 
[20:07.16]often were called Dutch. 
[20:09.49]This happened because of mistakes in understanding 
[20:12.73]and saying the word Deutsch, the German word for German. 
[20:17.79]Families of these German people still live 
[20:20.62]in the eastern United States, 
[20:22.89]many in the state of Pennsylvania. 
[20:25.57]They are known as the Pennsylvania Dutch.
[20:29.62]President Theodore Roosevelt once noted 
[20:33.18]that anything foreign and non-English was called Dutch. 
[20:37.76]One expression still in use¡ª
[20:40.33]to talk to someone like a Dutch uncle¡ª
[20:43.56]did come from the Dutch. 
[20:45.88]The Dutch were known for the firm way 
[20:48.22]they raised their children. 
[20:49.91]So if someone speaks to you like a Dutch uncle, 
[20:53.28]he is speaking in a very severe way. 
[20:56.62]And you should listen to him carefully!
[21:00.44]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage 
[21:04.31]you have just heard.
[21:06.55]22. What did Dutch expressions originally mean?
[21:27.23]23. What does the phrase ¡°in Dutch¡± mean?
[21:46.62]24. Why did American call Germans Dutch 
[21:51.01]in the eighteenth century?
[22:08.08]25. What can we learn from this passage?
[22:27.05]Section C
[22:28.54]Directions: In this section, 
[22:30.56]you will hear a passage three times, 
[22:33.69]when the passage is read for the first time, 
[22:36.08]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[22:39.88]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[22:42.74]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[22:45.44]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[22:48.41]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[22:51.78]you should check what you have written.
[22:54.48]Now listen to the passage.  
[22:57.33]Amazingly for the British, who love queues, 
[23:00.96]there is no formal line-up¡ª
[23:03.42]the bar staff are skilled at knowing 
[23:05.84]whose turn it is. 
[23:07.22]You are permitted to try to attract attention, 
[23:09.77]but there are rules about how to do this. 
[23:12.68]Do not call out£¬tap coins on the counter, 
[23:15.66]snap your finger or wave like a drowning swimmer. 
[23:19.58]And whatever you do, 
[23:21.12]do not ring the bell hanging behind the counter¡ª
[23:23.91]this is used by the landlord to signal closing time. 
[23:27.60]The key thing is to catch the bar worker¡¯s eyes. 
[23:32.65]Do adopt an expectant, hopeful, 
[23:35.15]even slightly anxious facial expression. 
[23:38.54]If you look too contented and complacent, 
[23:41.50]the bar staff may assume you are already being served. 
[23:45.47]Always say¡°please¡± and try to remember 
[23:48.31]some of the British bar staffs pet hates. 
[23:51.18]They do not like people who wait until the end of the order 
[23:54.30]before asking for such drinks as Guinness stout 
[23:57.64]which take considerably longer to pour than other drinks. 
[24:01.24]And they do not like people to keep others waiting 
[24:04.46]when they make up their minds.
[24:06.83]One Dutch tourist 
[24:08.54]who visited 800 of Britain¡¯s 61,000 pubs 
[24:12.66]and interviewed 50 publicans and bar workers 
[24:15.96]and more than 1,000 customers wondered 
[24:19.12]how the British ever manage to buy themselves a drink. 
[24:22.30]But they do, and if you follow these tips 
[24:25.29]you should be able to do so, too.
[24:28.07]Speaking of tips, 
[24:29.45]you should never offer the bar staff a cash gratuity. 
[24:33.07]The correct behavior is to offer them a drink. 
[24:36.66]A tip in cash would be a reminder of their service role, 
[24:40.83]whereas the offer of a drink is a friendly gesture.
[24:46.26]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:49.13]Amazingly for the British, who love queues,

[24:54.90]the bar staff are skilled at knowing 
[24:56.92]whose turn it is. 
[24:58.13]You are permitted to try to attract attention, 
[25:01.40]but there are rules about how to do this. 
[25:04.30]Do not call out£¬tap coins on the counter, 
[25:07.61]snap your finger or wave like a drowning swimmer. 
[25:11.28]And whatever you do, 
[25:13.21]do not ring the bell hanging behind the counter¡ª
[25:16.23]this is used by the landlord to signal closing time. 
[25:20.30]The key thing is to catch the bar worker¡¯s eyes. 
[25:23.90]Do adopt an expectant, hopeful, 
[25:27.37]even slightly anxious facial expression. 
[25:30.06]If you look too contented and complacent, 
[25:33.24]the bar staff may assume you are already being served. 
[25:37.30]Always say¡°please¡± and try to remember 
[25:40.04]some of the British bar staffs pet hates. 
[25:43.02]They do not like people who wait until the end of the order 
[25:46.24]before asking for such drinks as Guinness stout 
[25:49.56]which take considerably longer to pour than other drinks. 
[25:53.51]And they do not like people to keep others waiting 
[25:56.65]when they make up their minds.
[25:58.58]One Dutch tourist 
[25:59.97]who visited 800 of Britain¡¯s 61,000 pubs 
[26:03.92]and interviewed 50 publicans and bar workers 
[26:07.72]and more than 1,000 customers wondered 
[26:10.53]how the British ever manage to buy themselves a drink. 
[26:13.82]But they do, and if you follow these tips 
[26:17.08]you should be able to do so, too.
[26:20.39]Speaking of tips, 
[26:21.57]you should never offer the bar staff a cash gratuity. 
[26:25.37]The correct behavior is to offer them a drink. 
[26:28.64]A tip in cash would be a reminder of their service role, 
[26:32.28]whereas the offer of a drink is a friendly gesture.
