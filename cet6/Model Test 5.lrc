[00:07.74]Model Test Five
[00:09.55]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:12.35]Section A
[00:13.67]Directions: In this section, 
[00:16.08]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:18.88]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:21.51]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:23.87]one or more questions will be asked about what was said. 
[00:28.14]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:30.87]will be spoken only once. 
[00:33.24]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:36.29]During the pause, you must read the four choices 
[00:39.65]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:44.02]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:47.05]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:51.02]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.72]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[00:58.10]1. M: Miss Catherine,how long 
[01:01.17]has this tooth been giving you pain? 
[01:03.84]W: Well,I had it till last year 
[01:06.45]and was all right until last Friday.
[01:09.50]Unfortunately,it started hurting again.
[01:13.11]Q: How long has the woman had the toothache? 
[01:32.39]2. W: You must have had a wonderful time
[01:35.86]by using your new camera on your trip.
[01:38.83]M: I would have,but after buying a new camera 
[01:42.18]especially for that trip,
[01:44.93]I left it in the taxi when the taxi driver 
[01:46.99]drove me to the airport.
[01:49.28]Q: What did the man say about his camera? 
[02:08.47]3. W: Have Tom and Cathy started a family yet? 
[02:12.70]They¡¯ve been married for three years up to now.
[02:16.34]M: Tom indicated to me that they¡¯d postpone 
[02:19.29]having a baby until he gets his doctor degree.
[02:22.88]Q: What can we know about Tom 
[02:24.80]and Cathy from the conversation? 
[02:43.40]4. W: Jerry,can you pick me up after work today 
[02:48.15]since my car is at the repair shop.
[02:50.67]M: I¡¯m afraid I can¡¯t. I¡¯ve scheduled 
[02:53.17]an appointment with a client at dinner time.
[02:56.03]Q: What is the man going to do?
[03:14.01]5. M: I¡¯ve been waiting all week for Avantar.
[03:18.20]The movie is said to be excellent and fantastic.
[03:22.17]And with our student discount,
[03:24.15]the tickets will be a little cheap.
[03:26.60]W: Ah ah...I¡¯m afraid I left my student ID card in the dorm.
[03:34.57]Q: What does the woman imply?
[03:52.70]6. W: I¡¯m afraid Dr.Bruce won¡¯t be able to see you then.
[03:57.49]His appointment is filled for the next couple of weeks.
[04:01.15]M: Oh,but I don¡¯t have to see him.
[04:03.79]I¡¯ll just leave my teeth in his office 
[04:06.19]and he can look at them when he has time.
[04:09.00]They are my false teeth! 
[04:10.98]Q: What is Dr.Bruce?
[04:28.79]7. M: You got back for lunch so late today.
[04:33.23]You must hang out in certain place,did you? 
[04:36.67]W: No.I spent most of my lunch hour at the library, 
[04:40.46]but it was so quiet that I fell sound asleep.
[04:43.50]Q: Why did the woman come back late? 
[05:02.35]8. M: I¡¯m so anxiously waiting for my sister to come back
[05:07.21]and type some important documents for me.
[05:10.22]W: Why bother her?
[05:12.24]I¡¯ll show you how to use the typewriter.
[05:14.42]It¡¯s quite simple.
[05:16.32]Q: What does the woman mean? 
[05:34.66]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:38.29]Conversation One
[05:40.71]W: Professor Marnes, I wonder if you can fill me 
[05:43.62]in on your lecture last Friday.
[05:45.90]I had to attend a scholarship award ceremony.
[05:49.11]M: Oh well,congratulations.
[05:51.77]I hope you were rewarded handsomely!
[05:54.67]W: Well,every bit helps.
[05:56.78]So,about your lecture,
[05:58.44]I understand you were talking about extinctions.
[06:01.77]M: Yes.Well,the vital part of my talk was just that 
[06:05.80]we tend to think of extinction as a dramatic event,
[06:10.04]but most species die out over quite a period of time.
[06:14.38]W: Why do they die off? 
[06:16.20]I thought they were continuously improving themselves. 
[06:19.34]Natural selection,I think you once mentioned.
[06:22.56]M: Ah,but you see while there is 
[06:25.53]natural competition between the species,
[06:27.81]what determines which species survive is largely by chance.
[06:32.37]W: I don¡¯t get it.Why do species bother competing?
[06:36.33]M: Well,there are short term advantages.
[06:39.12]But many species also are helped by others.For example,
[06:43.38]the common housefly might 
[06:45.32]have died off years ago if not for humans.
[06:48.90]W: But you¡¯re not saying that 
[06:50.89]humans are so successful merely because of chance?
[06:53.98]M: To a certain extent,humans were initially lucky enough 
[06:57.45]to have the right weather conditions 
[06:59.31]and a lack of killers who live on us for food£¬
[07:02.78]but now,of course,we survive by cleverness.
[07:06.03]W: So we may never become extinct.
[07:08.64]M: No,because we may be in a crash course to extinction 
[07:13.03]by our continuous exploitation of the environment.
[07:16.86]We are a relatively young species 
[07:18.98]and our time is not yet overdue.
[07:22.23]W: But there are 6 billion of us!
[07:25.02]M: Yes,and there¡¯re many more houseflies too!
[07:28.52]Each with the capacity to spread one disease 
[07:31.53]from one person to another in a fast period of time. 
[07:36.20]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[07:39.40]you have just heard.
[07:41.68]9. Why did the woman go to see the professor? 
[08:01.84]10. What puzzles the woman about extinction?
[08:21.94]11. What does the man say about 
[08:24.99]humans¡¯successful survival?
[08:43.91]Conversation Two
[08:45.60]M: Hi,Sarah.What¡¯s up?
[08:47.64]W: Oh,hi,I just got out of a history class.
[08:50.95]I had to give a presentation.
[08:53.04]M: How did it go?
[08:54.33]W: Terribly.I¡¯m sure I made a fool of myself.
[08:57.70]M: Why? Weren¡¯t you prepared?
[08:59.88]W: No,it was not that. 
[09:01.68]It¡¯s just that I get so embarrassed and nervous 
[09:04.95]whenever I have to speak in front of a group of people. 
[09:08.58]I stand up and my face gets red 
[09:11.09]and then I get even more nervous 
[09:13.33]because I know everyone can see me blushing.
[09:16.18]M: It¡¯s not so bad to blush.
[09:17.98]W: But it happens all the time.
[09:20.61]If the professor asks a question and he calls on me,
[09:23.98]although I know the answer,
[09:25.85]I blush like crazy.Doesn¡¯t that ever happen to you?
[09:30.29]M: No,not really. 
[09:31.80]Maybe you should just try to forget about the people.
[09:35.40]Look at something else in the room like the exit sign.
[09:39.20]W: I guess I could try that but I doubt it¡¯ll help.
[09:42.58]M: You know,we talked about it in psychology class. 
[09:46.02]Blushing,even though it¡¯s involuntary,
[09:48.92]is more or less a learned behavior.
[09:51.73]W: What do you mean?
[09:53.22]M: Oh,children hardly ever blush at all.
[09:56.65]And among adults,supposedly,
[09:58.59]women blush more than men.
[10:00.48]W: I wonder why?
[10:02.00]M: I don¡¯t know, 
[10:03.61]but I had a friend at high school,Brian Smith.
[10:07.34]It was really easy to make him blush.
[10:10.32]He turned red 
[10:12.12]whenever a waitress would ask him for his order.
[10:14.70]W: I¡¯m not that bad.
[10:16.27]Well,I¡¯ve got to get going for my next class.
[10:19.41]I¡¯ll talk to you later. 
[10:21.56]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[10:25.31]you have just heard.
[10:27.31]12. What is the woman¡¯s problem?
[10:47.57]13. What does the man suggest the woman 
[10:51.33]do to avoid being nervous?
[11:09.04]14. What does the man say about blushing?
[11:29.48]15. Why does the man mention his friend Brian?
[11:51.29]Section B
[11:52.62]Directions: In this section, 
[11:54.42]you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:56.97]At the end of each passage, 
[11:58.58]you will hear some questions. 
[12:00.86]Both the passage and the questions 
[12:02.77]will be spoken only once. 
[12:04.88]After you hear a question, 
[12:06.37]you must choose the best answer 
[12:08.13]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[12:12.85]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[12:16.38]with a single line through the centre.
[12:19.31]Passage One
[12:21.08]We can agree with primitive man that food is a basic need, 
[12:25.43]but we differ from him in our food wants 
[12:28.18]because of the wide variety of food 
[12:31.02]we are available compared with him; 
[12:34.07]we have a wide choice.
[12:35.91]Take fruit for example,
[12:37.77]not only we enjoy the fruits in his century,
[12:41.16]but because of modern methods of transport 
[12:44.17]and food preservation,
[12:45.60]we can also enjoy the more fruits 
[12:48.03]from foreign countries thousands of miles away,
[12:51.90]whereas primitive man is limited in his choice 
[12:54.95]to the kinds of fruit which actually grow where he lives.
[12:59.40]However,though differ in satisfying their hunger,
[13:02.62]primitive and civilized men both experience the basic need for food.
[13:08.82]The same is true of the second of our human need.
[13:12.56]Clothing is necessary to regulate the heat of our bodies. 
[13:16.88]Since we live in a temperate climate 
[13:19.41]we need more clothes than people
[13:21.71]living in tropic conditions.
[13:23.86]Likewise,our clothing needs to be changed with seasons.
[13:28.21]Shelter,the third of our needs,depends on the climate,
[13:32.57]the skill of the builder,one¡¯s social position,
[13:36.05]and the materials available.
[13:38.40]The simple shelter of primitive man would not do for us,
[13:42.80]and yet it satisfies his needs.
[13:45.59]The three bedrooms suburban house of the average family 
[13:49.34]would not be grand enough for a rich family,
[13:52.58]and yet the modern house contains
[13:55.26]many of the material comforts 
[13:57.17]which were denied to the Kings and Queens of old.  
[14:01.37]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[14:04.89]you have just heard.
[14:06.83]16. With regard to food,
[14:09.89]how do we differ from the primitive people?
[14:28.85]17. Why does clothing need to change with seasons?
[14:50.12]18. What does shelter depend on according to the passage?
[15:12.47]Passage Two
[15:14.00]In November 1965,New York was blacked out
[15:17.79]by an electricity failure.
[15:20.15]The authorities promised that it would not happen again.
[15:23.69]Pessimists believed that it would occur again 
[15:26.57]within five years at the latest. 
[15:29.79]In July 1977, there was a repeat performance 
[15:34.27]which produced varying degrees of chaos 
[15:37.23]throughout the city of eight million people. 
[15:40.07]In 1965,the failure occurred in the cool autumn 
[15:44.61]and at a time of comparative prosperity. 
[15:47.55]In 1977,the disaster was much more serious 
[15:51.97]because it came when unemployment was high 
[15:55.13]and the city was suffering from one of its worst heat waves.
[15:59.21]In 1965,there was little crime during the darkness,
[16:04.27]and fewer than a hundred people were arrested.
[16:08.13]In 1977,hundreds of stores were broken into.
[16:12.43]Mobs smashed shop windows and helped themselves 
[16:16.34]to rob jewelry,clothes or television sets.
[16:19.80]Many people were arrested 
[16:21.65]but far more disappeared into the darkness of the night. 
[16:25.78]The number of policemen available was quite inadequate 
[16:29.17]and they wisely refrained from using their guns
[16:32.34]against mobs which far outnumbered them 
[16:35.01]and included armed men.
[16:38.19]Hospitals had to treat hundreds of people
[16:40.86]cut by glass from shop windows.
[16:43.93]Banks and most businesses remained closed the next day. 
[16:47.87]The blackout started at 9:30 p.m.,
[16:50.93]when lightning hit and knocked out vital cables.
[16:55.37]Many stores were thus caught by surprise.
[16:58.54]The vast majority of New Yorkers,
[17:01.09]however,were not involved in robbing.
[17:04.04]They helped strangers,distributed candles and batteries,
[17:08.15]and tried to survive in a nightmare world 
[17:10.87]without traffic lights,refrigerator,elevators,
[17:14.89]water and electrical power. 
[17:17.27]For twenty-four hours,New York realized 
[17:20.62]how helpless it was without electricity.  
[17:23.81]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage
[17:27.24]you have just heard.
[17:29.48]19. In what way was the blackout of 1977 
[17:34.64]different from that of 1965?
[17:53.52]20. Why did many mobs manage to escape?
[18:13.31]21. What caused the blackout in July 1977?
[18:35.13]22. How long did the 1977 New York electricity failure last?
[18:58.27]Passage Three
[18:59.90]Many people wonder about what television 
[19:02.54]has done to the generation of American children 
[19:05.76]who have grown up watching it.
[19:07.93]For one thing,recent studies show that TV 
[19:10.94]might hinder the children¡¯s creative ability 
[19:13.66]or restrain kids¡¯imagination who might think in a passive way.
[19:18.75]Some teachers feel that television 
[19:20.75]has taken away the child¡¯s ability
[19:23.24]to form mental pictures in his own mind, 
[19:26.49]resulting in children who cannot understand 
[19:29.66]a simple story without vivid pictures.
[19:32.58]It is quite harmful for the cognitive development 
[19:36.19]of these children.
[19:37.81]Secondly,watching too much TV too early 
[19:41.48]usually causes children to be removed from real-life experiences. 
[19:46.89]Thus,they may grow up to be passive watchers 
[19:49.94]who can only respond to action,
[19:52.60]but not start doing something in an active way.
[19:55.81]The third area for such a worrying situation 
[19:59.28]is the serious dissatisfaction frequently expressed 
[20:03.08]by school teachers that children show a low patience 
[20:06.77]for the pains in the course of learning.
[20:09.74]There are certain reasons:
[20:11.68]they have been used to seeing results of
[20:13.68]all problems in 30 or 60 minutes on TV,
[20:17.86]and they are quickly discouraged 
[20:20.20]by any activity that promises less than immediate satisfaction. 
[20:25.07]But perhaps the most serious result 
[20:27.31]is the TV effect of bloody fights 
[20:30.68]and death on children,who have come to believe 
[20:33.98]that it is an everyday thing. 
[20:36.27]Not only does this increase their admission of terrible acts 
[20:40.17]on others who they hate,
[20:42.09]but some children will follow anti-social acts
[20:45.32]that they see these on television. 
[20:48.65]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage 
[20:52.37]you have just heard.
[20:54.86]23. What does the passage mainly talk about£¿
[21:15.57]24. Which is the effect of watching
[21:18.97]too much TV too early on children?
[21:37.51]25. What on TV will have the most serious effect on children?
[21:59.72]Section C
[22:01.19]Directions: In this section, 
[22:03.28]you will hear a passage three times. 
[22:06.03]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[22:08.98]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[22:12.47]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[22:15.40]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[22:17.67]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[22:20.92]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[22:24.13]you should check what you have written.
[22:26.66]Now listen to the passage.
[22:30.07]New York is the most populous city in the United States,
[22:34.16]in a metropolitan area that ranks 
[22:36.30]among the world¡¯s most populous urban areas.
[22:39.20]It is a leading global city, 
[22:41.73]exerting a powerful influence over 
[22:44.26]worldwide commerce,finance,culture,and entertainment.
[22:49.37]The city is also an important center for international affairs,
[22:53.91]hosting the United Nations headquarters. 
[22:57.00]Located on the Atlantic coast of the Northeastern United States,
[23:01.72]the city consists of five distinct area. 
[23:05.52]New York is largely unique among American cities
[23:09.27]for its high use of mass transit,
[23:11.72]and the overall density and diversity of its population.
[23:16.26]The city is sometimes referred to as
[23:19.22]¡°The City That Never Sleeps¡± due to
[23:21.98]its extensive 24 hour subway system 
[23:25.06]and constant traffic and people.
[23:28.00]Founded as a commercial trading post by the Dutch in 1624,
[23:32.96]it served as the capital of the United States 
[23:35.91]from 1785 until 1790,
[23:39.75]and has been the nation¡¯s largest city since 1790. 
[23:43.65]The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants 
[23:47.25]as they came to America in the late 19th 
[23:50.65]and early 20th centuries.
[23:52.47]Wall Street has been a dominant 
[23:54.44]global financial center since World War II. 
[23:58.12]Today,the city has many renowned landmarks 
[24:01.32]and neighborhoods that are world famous.
[24:04.65]The city has been home to several of the tallest buildings
[24:07.63]in the world,including the Empire State Building 
[24:11.73]and the twin towers of the former World Trade Center. 
[24:15.16]New York is the birthplace of many cultural movements
[24:18.42]in literature and visual art, 
[24:20.76]abstract expressionism in painting,
[24:23.36]and hip hop,disco,music£¬etc. 
[24:29.31]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:33.40]New York is the most populous city in the United States,
