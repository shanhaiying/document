[00:07.45]Model Test One
[00:09.81]Part II Listening Comprehension      
[00:12.81]Section A
[00:13.93]Directions: In this section, 
[00:16.57]you will hear 8 short conversations 
[00:19.28]and 2 long conversations. 
[00:22.12]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:24.18]one or more questions will be asked about 
[00:27.42]what was said. 
[00:28.56]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:31.12]will be spoken only once. 
[00:33.74]After each question there will be a pause. 
[00:36.75]During the pause, 
[00:38.06]you must read the four choices 
[00:40.45]marked A), B), C) and D), 
[00:44.34]and decide which is the best answer. 
[00:47.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:51.44]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.06]Now let¡¯s begin with the eight short conversations.
[00:58.86]1. W: City life is so crowded. 
[01:02.33]I¡¯d like to get away sometimes to the forest 
[01:05.50]where I can think in peace and quiet.
[01:08.41]M: That¡¯s also my dream. 
[01:10.13]Living in the city, 
[01:11.09]I can never get the chance to think 
[01:13.29]about the meaning of life.
[01:15.55]Q: What are the two speakers mainly talking about?
[01:33.36]2. W: I kept looking for Mary at the seminar 
[01:36.91]but never did I see her. 
[01:38.64]I can¡¯t imagine she forgot about it. 
[01:41.02]She¡¯s been talking about it for weeks.
[01:43.73]M: Oh, she didn¡¯t. 
[01:45.40]It¡¯s just that she caught a really bad cold 
[01:47.71]a couple of days ago.
[01:49.34]Q: Why didn¡¯t Mary attend the seminar?
[02:06.59]3. W: Our history presentation is next Thursday. 
[02:10.34]When do you want to get together to work on it?
[02:13.03]M: Well, how about next Monday? 
[02:15.38]That way we will still have enough time 
[02:17.67]to figure out anything 
[02:18.87]we have trouble with.
[02:21.03]Q: What does the man suggest they do?
[02:38.54]4. W: I just heard the news that Mary won the election. 
[02:42.85]That must be a big disappointment for you.
[02:45.98]M: Well, actually, 
[02:47.26]she was the best candidate this time around, 
[02:49.66]and I can run again next year.
[02:52.03]Q: What do we learn about the man?
[03:08.61]5. W: My new neighbor next door is really great. 
[03:12.62]She¡¯s got fantastic collection of classical music; 
[03:16.02]I mean dozens of composers I¡¯ve never even heard of. 
[03:19.67]M: Hmm¡­ Just be careful, Annie, 
[03:22.44]a hobby like that can be infectious and expensive.
[03:26.92]Q: What does the man mean?
[03:43.46]6. M: How was your first meeting 
[03:46.19]with Tom¡¯s mother yesterday?
[03:47.74]W: I never expected it to be a problem. 
[03:50.78]But now I¡¯m upset about it. 
[03:52.54]I wonder why it¡¯s all right for me to date her son 
[03:55.75]but wrong to marry him.
[03:58.60]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[04:15.81]7. W: Do you believe that names say a lot about people 
[04:19.52]and even decide the fate of him or her?
[04:22.60]M: I heard someone said so. 
[04:24.79]From the perspective of psychology, 
[04:26.96]to some degree, 
[04:28.05]names can have a great influence on a person¡¯s identity.
[04:31.42]Q: How do names affect people according to the man?
[04:50.27]8. M: A recent poll said 50-60 percent of 
[04:54.82]the employees felt empty 
[04:56.24]though they had a good job with good salary.
[04:58.82]W: I think they have come to discover 
[05:00.65]that having a good job is not enough to create happiness. 
[05:04.01]There is more to life than having a good job.
[05:07.22]Q: Why are the employees unhappy according to the woman?
[05:24.88]Now you¡¯ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:28.03]Conversation One
[05:30.06]W: The book that we are going to talk about 
[05:32.58]is called The Greek Gods, 
[05:33.88]a Battle for Eternity. 
[05:35.51]And the interesting thing about this book 
[05:37.96]is that it is written in the form of a thriller. 
[05:40.89]Roger, why a thriller?
[05:43.40]M: Well, what you¡¯ve got to remember is the Greek Gods, 
[05:47.10]unlike those of previous cultures, 
[05:49.12]represent people both in appearance and in character. 
[05:52.67]And they mirror the kind of activities 
[05:54.62]that people got up to, war, intrigue, romance and so on. 
[05:58.63]W: Perhaps you could tell me a little 
[06:00.66]about some of the characters. 
[06:02.37]M: Certainly. I think most people have heard of Venus. 
[06:05.93]She is perhaps the most physically attractive of the Gods. 
[06:09.11]W: She was goddess of beauty, wasn¡¯t she? 
[06:11.83]M: Goddess of love and beauty, yes. 
[06:14.68]She appears on the surface 
[06:16.18]to have the most charming personality. 
[06:18.08]But in fact she is rather a nasty character. 
[06:21.07]W: Very interesting. Why do you say so? 
[06:24.48]M: She is forever tempting other gods with pretty girls, 
[06:27.47]and has a rather jealous nature. 
[06:29.88]If she is ever rejected by a male, 
[06:31.96]she is quite prepared to arrange an accident for him, 
[06:35.20]usually fatal. 
[06:36.40]W: Can you explain it in detail?
[06:38.25]M: Of course. 
[06:39.31]Everyone knows Zeus, 
[06:40.92]the ruler of Olympus and god of the weather. 
[06:43.86]He can be rather a violent character. 
[06:46.25]He is usually portrayed holding a flash of lightening 
[06:49.44]which he is always ready to use on anyone who annoys him. 
[06:53.05]But he is always deceived by Venus 
[06:55.52]who makes him fall in love with one woman after another. 
[06:58.42]Then he has to resort to all sorts of low tricks 
[07:01.62]to hide the affairs from his wife.
[07:04.29]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation 
[07:07.45]you have just heard.
[07:09.73]9. What does the woman consider interesting about the book?
[07:29.10]10. What impression does Venus give to the man?
[07:48.40]11. What do we learn about Zeus according to the man?
[08:07.37]Conversation Two
[08:09.13]W: Are you sure that 
[08:10.56]you¡¯ll need all this stuff? 
[08:12.46]Your father and I aren¡¯t going to rent a truck 
[08:15.65]to take your entire room to California with you.
[08:18.60]M: Come on, mom! 
[08:20.03]I know these hiking boots will come in handy! 
[08:22.53]And I definitely need those CDs. 
[08:24.70]W: Can¡¯t we just mail you some of your things 
[08:27.58]if you need them? 
[08:28.67]I don¡¯t think you will need all the stuff 
[08:31.13]on your first days in university.
[08:33.28]M: But it could take up to a week for me to receive things! 
[08:36.49]What if I can¡¯t wait that long!
[08:38.35]W: Well, we wouldn¡¯t want to do anything 
[08:40.95]to jeopardize your mental health, honey¡ª
[08:43.21]just try and limit everything to those suitcases 
[08:45.93]until we come down to visit you after Christmas. 
[08:49.41]I will be more than happy to mail anything you need to you.
[08:52.84]M: All right. 
[08:54.20]But I know I am going to forget something! What time is it? 
[08:57.31]W: 4:30. Why? 
[08:59.32]M: I promised Jessica 
[09:00.79]that I would go over to her house around 5 o¡¯clock 
[09:03.61]to help her fill out some forms for the police academy. 
[09:06.30]Can I finish doing this later?
[09:07.98]W: OK, I¡¯ll be glad to help you tomorrow afternoon 
[09:12.04]after I get back from playing tennis. 
[09:14.16]You have your airline ticket and the check-in 
[09:17.15]and arrival instructions 
[09:18.90]that the school sent to you, right? 
[09:20.90]You¡¯d better put them somewhere where you can find them.
[09:23.80]M: I¡¯ll try to be at home before 9 o¡¯clock. 
[09:25.95]I¡¯d like to get all of this stuff packed by Monday.
[09:28.88]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation 
[09:34.06]you have just heard.
[09:36.14]12. What are the two speakers mainly talking about?
[09:55.64]13. What does the woman suggest the man do?
[10:14.48]14. What will the man probably do around 5 o¡¯clock?
[10:34.45]15. What will the woman probably do tomorrow afternoon?
[10:54.28]Section B
[10:55.28]Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. 
[11:00.97]At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. 
[11:05.41]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. 
[11:10.00]After you hear a question, 
[11:11.91]you must choose the best answer from the four choices 
[11:15.34]marked A), B), C) and D). 
[11:19.39]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:23.62]with a single line through the centre.
[11:26.85]Passage One
[11:28.85]Until the 20th century cigarette smoking 
[11:31.14]was not a widespread habit. 
[11:33.41]The cigarette industry started in the 1870¡¯s 
[11:36.16]with the development of cigarette manufacturing machines. 
[11:39.58]It helped produce great numbers of cigarettes very quickly 
[11:42.74]and reduced the price greatly. 
[11:44.82]And consequently more and more people, 
[11:46.70]both men and women, 
[11:48.00]began to smoke cigarettes. 
[11:49.98]Men as a group, however, smoke more than women. 
[11:52.96]But the highest proportion of smokers is found 
[11:55.81]in the age group of 24-44, 
[11:58.11]regardless of sex difference. 
[12:00.11]Income, education, 
[12:01.45]and occupation all play a part in determining a person¡¯s smoking habits. 
[12:06.53]City people smoke more than people living on farms. 
[12:09.69]Well-educated men with high incomes 
[12:11.85]are less likely to smoke cigarettes than men 
[12:14.27]with fewer years of schooling and lower incomes. 
[12:17.55]On the other hand, 
[12:18.54]if a well-educated man with a higher income smokes at all, 
[12:22.65]he is likely to smoke more packs of cigarettes per day. 
[12:25.77]The situation is somewhat different from woman. 
[12:28.29]There are slightly more smokers among women 
[12:31.03]with higher family incomes and higher education 
[12:34.55]than among the lower income and lower education groups. 
[12:38.11]These more highly educated women tend to smoke more heavily. 
[12:41.95]Among teenagers the picture is similar. 
[12:44.60]There are fewer teenage smokers from upper-income, 
[12:47.75]well-educated families, 
[12:49.42]and fewer from families living in farm areas. 
[12:52.80]High school students 
[12:53.81]who are preparing for college 
[12:55.48]are less likely to smoke than those 
[12:56.90]who do not plan to continue their education after high school. 
[13:00.33]Children are most likely to start smoking 
[13:02.49]if one or both of their parents smoke.
[13:06.81]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage 
[13:10.08]you have just heard.
[13:12.23]16. Why did smoking become widespread in the 20th century?
[13:33.36]17. Which age group of people takes up the highest proportion 
[13:38.32]among the smokers?
[13:54.80]18. Which group of teenagers is most likely 
[13:58.79]to smoke according to the passage?
[14:15.56]Passage Two
[14:17.23]Water is necessary for life and good health. 
[14:20.61]We often forget this fact 
[14:22.38]when we think about the other building blocks of life 
[14:25.15]such as vitamins, minerals and proteins. 
[14:28.66]We can live for many days without eating, 
[14:30.86]but 2 or 3 days without water usually leads to death. 
[14:35.31]New born babies are as much as 85 percent water. 
[14:39.04]Women are about 65 percent water 
[14:41.22]and men are about 75 percent. 
[14:44.60]Women usually have less water than men 
[14:47.05]because women in general have more fat cells, 
[14:49.62]which hold less water than other cells. 
[14:52.18]Water contains many different substances to keep us healthy 
[14:55.80]and carries away waste materials. 
[14:58.16]For example, blood is 83 percent water, 
[15:01.39]muscles are 75 percent water, 
[15:04.33]the brain is 74 percent, and bones are 25 percent. 
[15:08.91]Water is also necessary for cooling the body on hot days. 
[15:13.25]Water carries body heat to the surface of the skin 
[15:16.12]where the heat is lost through sweat. 
[15:18.75]Researchers say cold liquids cool us faster than warm liquids. 
[15:24.24]They say, however, 
[15:25.42]that cold sweet drinks do not work well 
[15:27.58]because the sugar slows the liquid 
[15:29.38]from getting into the blood stream. 
[15:31.66]If we lose too much water we will become sick. 
[15:34.76]A 10 percent drop in body water 
[15:36.70]can cause the blood system to fall. 
[15:38.87]A 15 percent to 20 percent drop usually leads to death. 
[15:44.17]To replace what is lost, 
[15:45.77]health experts say, grown person should drink about 
[15:49.47]2 liters of liquids each day, 
[15:51.49]and more in hot weather. 
[15:53.49]They say we also can get some of the water 
[15:56.00]we need in the foods we eat.
[15:59.14]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage 
[16:03.09]you have just heard.
[16:04.93]19. Why do women have less water than men?
[16:23.68]20. What is the function of water in human body?
[16:42.66]21. How is body heat released in human?
[17:01.98]22. Why aren¡¯t cold sweet drinks 
[17:06.03]so effective for cooling the body?
[17:22.89]Passage Three
[17:24.60]Sex prejudices are based on and justified by the ideology 
[17:28.11]that biology is destiny. 
[17:30.67]According to this ideology, 
[17:32.34]basic biological and psychological differences 
[17:35.16]exist between the sexes. 
[17:37.00]These differences require each sex 
[17:39.25]to play a separate role in social life. 
[17:42.11]Women are the weaker sex both physically and emotionally. 
[17:45.86]Thus they are naturally suited much more than men 
[17:49.65]to the performance of domestic duties. 
[17:51.76]A woman¡¯s place under normal circumstances is 
[17:54.58]within the protective environment of the home. 
[17:57.05]Nature has determined that women play care-taker roles, 
[18:00.94]such as wife and mother and homemaker. 
[18:03.65]The ideology also holds that women 
[18:05.94]who wish to work outside the household 
[18:08.68]should naturally fill these jobs 
[18:10.85]that are in line with the special capabilities of their sex. 
[18:14.73]It is thus appropriate for women not men 
[18:17.39]to be employed as nurses, 
[18:19.31]social workers and elementary school teachers. 
[18:21.92]These positions are simply an extension 
[18:24.07]of women¡¯s domestic role. 
[18:25.65]Informal distinctions between women¡¯s work 
[18:28.09]and men¡¯s work in the labor force, 
[18:30.46]according to the ideology, 
[18:31.93]are simply a functional reflection of the basic differences 
[18:35.25]between the sexes. 
[18:36.75]Finally the ideology suggests 
[18:38.99]that nature has worked her will 
[18:41.49]in another significant way. 
[18:43.49]Thus women must make the most of their physical appearance 
[18:46.32]whether at home or in the labor force. 
[18:49.08]So goes the ideology. 
[18:51.26]It is of course not true 
[18:52.78]that basic biological and psychological differences 
[18:55.22]between the sexes 
[18:56.17]require each to play sex defined roles in social life. 
[19:00.08]There is ample evidence that sex roles 
[19:02.48]vary from society to society. 
[19:04.58]And those role differences that do exist 
[19:07.45]are largely learned.
[19:10.07]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage 
[19:13.57]you have just heard.
[19:15.91]23. What is the passage mainly talking about?
[19:35.64]24. What work should women do 
[19:38.73]according to the ideology?
[19:55.73]25. What¡¯s the author¡¯s opinion on sex differences?
[20:14.79]Section C
[20:16.23]Directions: In this section, 
[20:18.61]you will hear a passage three times. 
[20:21.46]When the passage is read for the first time, 
[20:24.20]you should listen carefully for its general idea. 
[20:27.87]When the passage is read for the second time, 
[20:30.79]you are required to fill in the blanks 
[20:33.31]with the exact words you have just heard. 
[20:36.12]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, 
[20:39.92]you should check what you have written.
[20:42.24]Now listen to the passage.
[20:45.13]In most parts of the world, 
[20:46.54]the relation between population and resources 
[20:49.09]is already unfavorable 
[20:51.07]and will probably become even more unfavorable 
[20:53.33]in the future. 
[20:54.72]This growing poverty constitutes a permanent menace 
[20:58.03]not only to peace, 
[20:59.39]but also to democratic institutions and personal liberty. 
[21:02.86]An unfavorable relationship 
[21:04.47]between numbers and resources 
[21:06.11]tends to make the earning of a living 
[21:08.53]almost intolerably difficult. 
[21:10.55]The individual is compelled to work long hours 
[21:12.89]for little pay. 
[21:14.20]No surplus of accumulated purchasing power stands 
[21:17.43]between him and the cruelty of unfriendly nature. 
[21:20.97]Democracy is, 
[21:22.02]among other things, 
[21:23.49]the ability to say ¡°no¡± to the boss. 
[21:26.69]But a man cannot say ¡°no¡± to the boss, 
[21:29.28]unless he is sure of being able to eat 
[21:31.57]when the boss¡¯s favor has been withdrawn. 
[21:34.31]And he cannot be certain of his next meal 
[21:36.30]unless he owns the means of producing enough wealth 
[21:39.18]for his family to live on, 
[21:40.72]or has been able to accumulate a surplus 
[21:43.46]out of past wages, 
[21:45.34]or has a chance of moving to virgin territories, 
[21:48.93]where he can make a fresh start. 
[21:51.24]In an overcrowded country, 
[21:52.97]very few people own enough to make them 
[21:54.89]financially independent; 
[21:56.75]very few are in a position to accumulate purchasing power; 
[22:00.52]and there is no free land. 
[22:02.65]Moreover, 
[22:03.26]in any country 
[22:04.25]where population presses hard upon natural resources, 
[22:07.57]the general economic situation 
[22:09.22]is apt to be so uncertain. 
[22:12.60]As a result, government control of capital and labor, 
[22:15.99]production and consumption becomes inevitable. 
[22:18.56]It is no accident that the 20th century 
[22:20.79]should be the century of highly centralized governments 
[22:24.01]and dictatorships; 
[22:25.48]it had to be so for the simple reason 
[22:27.71]that the 20th century is the century of global overcrowding.
[22:33.38]Now the passage will be read again.
[22:36.93]In most parts of the world, 
[22:38.61]the relation between population and resources 
[22:41.52]is already unfavorable 
[22:43.51]and will probably become even more unfavorable 
[22:46.22]in the future. 
[22:47.49]This growing poverty constitutes a permanent menace 
[22:50.87]not only to peace, 
[22:52.61]but also to democratic institutions and personal liberty. 
[22:56.51]An unfavorable relationship 
[22:58.24]between numbers and resources 
[23:00.45]tends to make the earning of a living 
[23:02.73]almost intolerably difficult. 
[23:05.38]The individual is compelled to work long hours 
[23:08.17]for little pay. 
[23:09.48]No surplus of accumulated purchasing power stands 
[23:12.94]between him and the cruelty of unfriendly nature. 
[23:16.20]Democracy is, 
[23:17.25]among other things, 
[23:18.67]the ability to say ¡°no¡± to the boss. 
[23:21.32]But a man cannot say ¡°no¡± to the boss, 
[23:23.82]unless he is sure of being able to eat 
[23:26.42]when the boss¡¯s favor has been withdrawn. 
[23:29.33]And he cannot be certain of his next meal 
[23:31.73]unless he owns the means of producing enough wealth 
[23:34.53]for his family to live on, 
[23:36.70]or has been able to accumulate a surplus 
[23:39.52]out of past wages, 
[23:41.04]or has a chance of moving to virgin territories, 
[23:44.35]where he can make a fresh start. 
[23:46.95]In an overcrowded country, 
[23:48.80]very few people own enough to make them 
[23:51.20]financially independent; 
[23:53.04]very few are in a position to accumulate purchasing power; 
[23:57.50]and there is no free land. 
[23:59.42]Moreover, 
[24:00.05]in any country 
[24:00.95]where population presses hard upon natural resources, 
[24:04.54]the general economic situation 
[24:06.52]is apt to be so uncertain. 
[24:09.56]As a result, government control of capital and labor, 
[24:13.42]production and consumption becomes inevitable. 
[24:17.86]It is no accident that the 20th century 
[24:21.05]should be the century of highly centralized governments 
[24:23.99]and dictatorships; 
[24:25.84]it had to be so for the simple reason 
[24:28.38]that the 20th century is the century of global overcrowding.
[24:33.21]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[24:37.80]In most parts of the world, 
[24:39.20]the relation between population and resources 
[24:41.73]is already unfavorable 
[24:43.78]and will probably become even more unfavorable 
[24:46.02]in the future. 
[24:47.39]This growing poverty constitutes a permanent menace 
[24:50.68]not only to peace, 
[24:52.04]but also to democratic institutions and personal liberty. 
[24:55.51]An unfavorable relationship 
[24:57.20]between numbers and resources 
[24:58.89]tends to make the earning of a living 
[25:01.21]almost intolerably difficult. 
[25:03.31]The individual is compelled to work long hours 
[25:05.67]for little pay. 
[25:06.98]No surplus of accumulated purchasing power stands 
[25:10.07]between him and the cruelty of unfriendly nature. 
[25:13.62]Democracy is, 
[25:14.68]among other things, 
[25:16.10]the ability to say ¡°no¡± to the boss. 
[25:19.35]But a man cannot say ¡°no¡± to the boss, 
[25:21.93]unless he is sure of being able to eat 
[25:24.28]when the boss¡¯s favor has been withdrawn. 
[25:27.01]And he cannot be certain of his next meal 
[25:28.99]unless he owns the means of producing enough wealth 
[25:31.68]for his family to live on, 
[25:33.40]or has been able to accumulate a surplus 
[25:36.13]out of past wages, 
[25:38.01]or has a chance of moving to virgin territories, 
[25:41.61]where he can make a fresh start. 
[25:43.91]In an overcrowded country, 
[25:45.69]very few people own enough to make them 
[25:47.55]financially independent; 
[25:49.41]very few are in a position to accumulate purchasing power; 
[25:53.11]and there is no free land. 
[25:55.33]Moreover, 
[25:55.97]in any country 
[25:56.69]where population presses hard upon natural resources, 
[26:00.22]the general economic situation 
[26:01.92]is apt to be so uncertain. 
[26:05.28]As a result, government control of capital and labor, 
[26:08.61]production and consumption becomes inevitable. 
[26:11.23]It is no accident that the 20th century 
[26:13.41]should be the century of highly centralized governments 
[26:16.69]and dictatorships; 
[26:18.17]it had to be so for the simple reason 
[26:20.35]that the 20th century is the century of global overcrowding.
[26:25.31]This is the end of listening comprehension.
