[00:07.78]Model Test Four
[00:09.86]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:12.78]Section A
[00:14.30]Directions: In this section,
[00:16.53]you will hear 8 short conversations
[00:19.29]and 2 long conversations.
[00:22.40]At the end of each conversation,
[00:24.33]one or more questions will be asked
[00:27.06]about what was said.
[00:28.46]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:31.30]will be spoken only once. 
[00:33.78]After each question
[00:35.45]there will be a pause. During the pause,
[00:38.23]you must read the four choices
[00:40.38]marked A), B), C) and D),
[00:44.52]and decide which is the best answer.
[00:47.37]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:49.64]on Answer Sheet 1
[00:51.26]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.90]Now let몶s begin with the eight short conversations.
[00:59.56]1. M: I do like those colorful birds.
[01:03.24]I think you can teach them to talk.
[01:06.08]W: Yes.But they are too expensive.
[01:09.39]Frankly,I몶d rather buy a parrot here.
[01:12.52]Q: Where did this conversation take place?
[01:31.43]2. M: Cathy, did you see Susan in the business office?
[01:36.17]I have some urgent matters 
[01:37.48]to negotiate with her at present.
[01:40.29]W: Yes,she was applying for a student loan.
[01:44.13]Q: What was Susan doing?
[02:01.57]3. W: Why do we always have to argue about money?
[02:05.89]I would rather go out and spend it all
[02:08.69]so that we wouldn몶t have to argue about it.
[02:11.54]M: If it weren몶t money,
[02:12.82]you몶d argue about something else.
[02:15.09]I think you enjoy arguments.
[02:17.33]Q: According to the man,which statement
[02:19.28]best describes the woman?
[02:37.52]4. W밐There is nothing I like
[02:40.12]more than a good mystery novel
[02:42.60]when I have got some spare time.What about you?
[02:46.36]M: I like reading,too,but I prefer non-fiction.
[02:50.73]Q: What can we know about the man?
[03:08.91]5. M: Have you and your family lived
[03:11.85]in Chicago for a long time?
[03:14.37]W: Oh,no.We've lived there just for two years.
[03:18.24]Then we moved to Seattle where my oldest child was born
[03:22.08]because my husband was teaching there.
[03:25.13]Q: What did the woman say about life in Chicago?
[03:44.65]6. W: Aren't you leaving tomorrow for vacation? 
[03:48.88]Have you got all the things packed and ready to go?
[03:52.08]M: Not quite. 
[03:53.25]I still have to stop by the drugstore 
[03:55.55]and get my allergy prescription refilled.
[03:58.60]Q: What does the man imply? 
[04:15.13]7. M: I몶m here for the job you advertised in the paper.
[04:21.47]W: You need one of those application forms over there,
[04:25.01]on the table next to the filing cabinet.
[04:28.67]Q: What will the man do?
[04:46.40]8. W: Do you have David몶s telephone number in Paris?
[04:51.87]M: Not yet.But he promised to send it to me
[04:54.81]as soon as he had a phone installed.
[04:57.54]Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
[05:16.43]Now you몶ll hear the two long conversations.
[05:19.92]Conversation One
[05:21.99]M: Hey,any idea of what to do this summer vacation?
[05:25.50]There doesn몶t seem to be any jobs available.
[05:28.86]W: Why don몶t you try house-sitting?
[05:31.05]Last summer my friend Marsha house-sat for the Howards
[05:34.34]when they went away on vacation.
[05:37.49]Mr.Howard hired Marsha to stay in their house
[05:41.00]because he didn몶t want to leave it empty.
[05:43.82]M: You mean the Howards paid Marsha
[05:46.14]just to live in their house?
[05:48.49]W: It wasn몶t that easy.
[05:50.22]She had to mow the lawn and water the house plants.
[05:53.28]And when Eric house-sat for Dr.Cohen,
[05:56.30]he had to take care of his pets.
[05:58.62]M: House-sitting sounds like a good job.
[06:01.34]I guess it is a little like baby-sitting
[06:04.11]except you take care of a house instead of children.
[06:07.97]W: The student employment office still has a few jobs posted.
[06:12.71]M: Do I just have to fill out an application?
[06:15.89]W: Margaret and Eric had the interview with the homeowners
[06:19.72]and provided three references each.
[06:22.68]M: That seems like a lot of trouble for a summer job.
[06:26.11]W: Well,the homeowners want some guarantee
[06:28.96]that they can trust the house-sitter.
[06:31.60]You know they want to make sure you몶re not the type of person
[06:34.59]who몶ll throw wild parties in their house,
[06:37.47]or move a group of friends in with you.
[06:40.41]M: House-sitters who do that sort of thing
[06:42.98]probably aren몶t paid then.
[06:45.17]W: Usually they몶re paid anyway just because 
[06:47.80]the homeowners don몶t want to make a fuss.
[06:51.17]But if the homeowner reported it,
[06:53.66]then the house-sitter wouldn몶t be able to get another job.
[06:57.45]So why don몶t you apply?
[06:59.17]M: Yeah,I think I will.
[07:01.36]Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation
[07:04.79]you have just heard.
[07:06.94]9. What does the woman suggest the man do
[07:10.35]in the summer vacation?
[07:29.11]10. What did the Howards do 
[07:32.17]when they went away last summer?
[07:51.44]11. What did Dr.Cohen ask Eric specifically to do
[07:57.56]when he house-sat for him?
[08:15.85]12. How do homeowners decide to hire a house-sitter?
[08:37.56]Conversation Two
[08:39.41]W: Hey!Are you going to play some tennis this afternoon?
[08:43.22]M: Well,to tell you the truth,
[08:45.18]I몶m not feeling so hot today.
[08:47.88]W: Come on.How long has it been since we played?
[08:51.47]M: A couple of days.
[08:53.01]W: A couple of days? Come on.
[08:55.55]It몶s been more than a couple of days.
[08:57.66]M: Yeah.I guess you몶re right.It몶s been almost a week.
[09:01.80]W: It몶s been exactly a week.
[09:04.31]And we used to play at least three times a week.
[09:07.75]M: I know.Playing right after class
[09:10.62]was something to look forward to.
[09:12.94]W: Yeah.And it was right before dinner.
[09:15.68]So we build up our appetite.
[09:17.59]M: I몶ve just been very busy,I guess.
[09:20.50]And my stomach is bothering me today.
[09:23.58]W: But you look OK to me.
[09:25.77]M: Well,I was up late with Steve in the library
[09:28.68]working on a project.We have to turn it in
[09:31.99]by tomorrow for that history class.
[09:34.98]We몶ve been working on it all weekend.
[09:37.03]And I was drinking a lot of coffee.
[09:39.61]I guess I just drank too much.
[09:42.10]W: Listen.I took that class last semester.
[09:45.38]And I could meet you in the library later tonight
[09:48.20]and help you if you want. And then you have time
[09:51.38]to play tennis this afternoon.
[09:53.69]M: Yeah.I guess my stomach doesn몶t ache that bad.
[09:57.19]And I could certainly use your help.But it몶s also...
[10:02.58]W: Is there something else bothering you?
[10:04.95]M: Well,to be honest,I몶m getting tired of losing.
[10:10.41]Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation
[10:14.27]you have just heard.
[10:16.43]13. What are the speakers mainly discussing?
[10:36.67]14. When was the last time
[10:40.01]the speakers played tennis together?
[10:58.04]15. What does the woman offer to do for the man?
[11:19.41]Section B
[11:21.02]Directions: In this section,
[11:23.76]you will hear 3 short passages.
[11:26.87]At the end of each passage,
[11:29.09]you will hear some questions.
[11:31.32]Both the passage and the questions
[11:33.27]will be spoken only once.
[11:35.92]After you hear a question,
[11:37.63]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[11:41.05]marked A), B), C) and D).
[11:45.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 
[11:48.79]with a single line through the centre.
[11:52.76]Passage One
[11:54.27]Many countries of the world have been faced with 
[11:57.35]the problem of how to make their workers more productive.
[12:01.67]Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied.
[12:07.24]But do more varied jobs lead to greater productivity?
[12:11.53]There is an evidence suggesting that
[12:13.38]while variety certainly makes the workers몶life
[12:16.38]more enjoyable,it does not actually make them work harder.
[12:21.02]Other experts feel that giving the worker freedom
[12:24.32]to do his job in his own way is important
[12:28.26]and there is no doubt that it is true.
[12:31.06]The problem is that this kind of freedom
[12:33.58]cannot easily be given in the modern factory.
[12:37.62]Thus while freedom of choice may be important,
[12:40.98]there is usually very little that can be done to create it.
[12:45.00]Another important consideration is 
[12:47.77]how much each worker contributes to the product he is making.
[12:52.44]In most factories
[12:53.73]the worker sees only one small part of the project.
[12:57.80]Some car factories are now experimenting with
[13:01.38]having many small production lines rather than a large one,
[13:05.91]so that each worker contributes more to
[13:08.60]the production of the cars on his line.
[13:12.22]It would seem that not only is the degree
[13:14.75]of workers몶contribution an important factor,
[13:18.51]but it is also one we can do something about.
[13:22.22]The workers themselves certainly think
[13:24.95]more money lead to greater productivity.
[13:27.85]But perhaps they want more money
[13:30.43]only because the work they do is so boring.
[13:34.10]Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more.
[13:37.98]Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting,
[13:42.65]they will neither want more money,
[13:44.67]nor will shorter working hours be so important to them.
[13:49.61]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage
[13:53.13]you have just heard.
[13:55.48]16. What does the author think of making jobs more varied?
[14:16.16]17. According to the passage,what is the problem
[14:21.30]of giving the workers freedom?
[14:38.54]18. What can we learn about the workers' contribution from the passage?
[15:01.12]19. What would workers do 
[15:03.80]if making their jobs more interesting?
[15:23.53]Passage Two
[15:25.10]What was the most popular mix about the United States
[15:28.88]in the 19th Century was that of the free life of the farmer.
[15:33.45]It was said that the farmers worked hard on their own land
[15:37.72]to produce whatever their families몶needed.
[15:41.10]They might sometimes trade with their neighbors,
[15:44.32]but in general they could get along just fine
[15:48.23]by relying on themselves,not on commercial ties with others.
[15:53.80]This is how Thomas Jefferson idealized the farmers
[15:57.77]at the beginning of the 19th century.
[16:01.32]But by the mid century sweeping changes in agriculture
[16:06.05]were well under way as farmers began to specialize in 
[16:10.27]the raising of crops such as corn or wheat.
[16:14.68]By late in the century revolutionary inventions
[16:18.32]in farm machinery
[16:19.95]had vastly increased the production of specialized crops
[16:23.94]and extensive network of railroads had linked farmers
[16:28.06]throughout the country to markets 
[16:30.38]in the east and even overseas.
[16:33.58]By raising and selling specialized crops,
[16:36.92]farmers could afford more and more finer goods
[16:40.81]and achieve much higher standards of living.
[16:44.12]Now farmers were no longer dependent just on 
[16:47.77]the weather and their own efforts,
[16:50.60]their lives were increasingly controlled by the banks,
[16:54.09]which had power to grant or deny loans for new machinery,
[16:58.66]and by the railroads
[17:00.12]which set the rates for shipping their crops to the market.
[17:04.96]As businessmen,farmers now had to worry about 
[17:08.41]national economic depression and the implement of world supply 
[17:13.51]and demand on밃for example,the price of wheat in hands.
[17:19.34]And so by the end of the 19th century,
[17:22.61]the era Jefferson몶s independent farmer had come to a close.
[17:27.86]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage
[17:31.63]you have just heard.
[17:33.62]20. What does the passage mainly talk about?
[17:53.78]21. What was the major change in agriculture
[17:58.38]during the 19th century?
[18:16.13]22. What was one result of
[18:19.48]the increased use of machinery on farms?
[18:39.92]Passage Three
[18:42.20]To see if hair color affects a person몶s chances 
[18:45.33]of getting a job, researchers at California State University asked 
[18:51.21]136 college students to review the resume and photograph 
[18:55.91]of a female applicant for a job as an accountant. 
[19:00.20]Each student was given the same resume. 
[19:03.05]But the applicant몶s picture was altered, 
[19:05.32]so that in some photos her hair was golden, 
[19:08.34]in some red and in some brown. The result? 
[19:13.88]With brown hair, the woman was rated more capable,
[19:17.44]and she was offered a higher salary 
[19:19.66]than when she had golden or red hair. 
[19:22.73]Other studies have found similar results. 
[19:25.87]Many respondents rate women with golden hair 
[19:28.35]as less intelligence than other people, 
[19:30.58]and red heads as more temperamental. 
[19:33.87]Women with red or golden hair are victims of 
[19:36.63]the common practice of stereotyping. 
[19:40.01]A stereotype is a simplistic or exaggerated image 
[19:43.62]that humans carry in their minds about groups of people. 
[19:47.84]For example, "lawyers are shrewd and dishonest" 
[19:51.36]is a popular stereotype. 
[19:54.06]Stereotyping can occur in public speaking classes. 
[19:57.98]When trying to choose a speech topic, 
[20:00.14]some males think that women are uninterested in 
[20:02.79]how to repair cars, 
[20:04.86]while some females think that men are uninterested in 
[20:07.70]creative hobbies, such as knitting and needle point. 
[20:12.20]We should reject stereotypes, because they force all people 
[20:15.77]in a group into the same simple pattern. 
[20:19.42]They fail to account for individual differences, 
[20:22.33]and the wide range of characteristics among members of any group. 
[20:26.83]Some lawyers are dishonest, yes! But many are not.
[20:30.92]Some women are uninterested in repairing cars, yes! 
[20:34.70]But some are enthusiastic mechanics.
[20:38.39]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage
[20:42.24]you have just heard.
[20:44.24]23. What did researchers at California State University find?모모
[21:06.23]24: What is the popular stereotype of lawyers?모모
[21:28.71]25: Why does the speaker say we should reject stereotypes?
[21:51.82]Section C
[21:53.23]Directions: In this section,
[21:55.61]you will hear a passage three times.
[21:58.44]When the passage is read for the first time,
[22:01.22]you should listen carefully for its general idea.
[22:04.90]When the passage is read for the second time,
[22:07.72]you are required to fill in the blanks
[22:10.34]with the exact words you have just heard.
[22:13.15]Finally, when the passage is read for the third time,
[22:16.94]you should check what you have written.
[22:19.25]Now listen to the passage.
[22:21.36]Australia,officially the Commonwealth of Australia,
[22:25.52]is a country in the southern hemisphere.
[22:28.27]It comprises the mainland of the world몶s smallest continent,
[22:32.21]the major island of Tasmania,
[22:34.97]and numerous other islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
[22:39.14]And it also has many neighboring countries.
[22:42.59]For around 40,000 years before European settlement
[22:46.44]commenced in the late 18th century,
[22:49.32]the Australian mainland and Tasmania were inhabited
[22:53.13]by around 250 individual nations of local Australians.
[22:59.41]After scattered visits by fishermen from the north,
[23:03.18]and European discovery by Dutch explorers in 1606,
[23:08.05]the eastern half of Australia was claimed by the British 
[23:11.99]in 1770 and initially settled in the colony of New South Wales,
[23:18.18]founded on 26 January 1788.
[23:22.92]The population grew steadily in the following years
[23:26.27]and the continent was explored thoroughly.
[23:29.41]During the 19th century
[23:31.14]another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies
[23:35.35]were established.
[23:37.56]Since the six colonies became a federation
[23:40.76]and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed,
[23:43.44]Australia has maintained
[23:45.28]a stable liberal democratic political system
[23:49.14]and remains a Commonwealth realm.
[23:52.09]The population is just over 21.3 million,
[23:56.08]with about 60% concentrated in and around 
[23:59.55]the mainland state capitals of Sydney,Melbourne,etc.
[24:05.05]Technologically advanced and industrialized,
[24:08.62]Australia is a prosperous multicultural country
[24:12.42]and has good results in many international comparisons
[24:16.15]of national performance밃such as health care,public education,
[24:21.28]economic freedom,and the protection of civil liberties
[24:25.43]and political rights.
[24:28.94]Now the passage will be read again.
[24:32.41]Australia,officially the Commonwealth of Australia,
[24:36.26]is a country in the southern hemisphere.
[24:38.92]It comprises the mainland of the world몶s smallest continent,

[26:16.53]economic freedom,and the protection of civil liberties
[26:19.98]and political rights.
[26:22.71]Now the passage will be read for the third time.
[26:26.16]Australia,officially the Commonwealth of Australia,
[26:30.18]is a country in the southern hemisphere.
[26:32.93]It comprises the mainland of the world몶s smallest continent,
