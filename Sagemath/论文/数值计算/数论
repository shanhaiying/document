Numerical Sage   
This document is designed to introduce the reader to the tools in Sage that are useful for doing numerical computation. It is currently a bit outdated, but work is being done to bring it up to date.

Three Lectures about Explicit Methods in Number Theory Using Sage   
This document is about using the mathematics software Sage to do computations with number fields and modular forms. It assumes no prior knowledge about Sage, but assumes a graduate level background in algebraic number theory.
